# The Deck of Many Things - MTG Crossover Project

Welcome to a complete Magic: The Gathering crossover of D&D's infamous Deck of Many Things! This project reimagines one of tabletop gaming's most chaotic artifacts through the lens of Magic's mechanical framework.

## Overview

This collection features 121 custom cards spread across three historical versions of the Deck:
- Original Deck (OG) - 22 cards
- Expansion Deck (EX) - 45 cards
- Harrow Deck (HW) - 54 cards
- Wonder Deck (WO) - 22 cards (Added 2/16/2025)

Each card has been carefully designed to maintain the spirit of its D&D counterpart while functioning within Magic's rules system. Where direct translation wasn't possible, we've created new interpretations that capture the original card's essence.

## Features

- Complete rule system for integrating the Deck into any Magic game
- Fate Point mechanic for managing deck draws
- Optional rules for varied gameplay experiences
- High-resolution card images for printing with appropriate bleed margins

## Using the Deck

The Deck of Many Things operates as a supplemental deck placed in the command zone. Players can interact with it through the Fate Point system, choosing when to risk drawing from its chaos-inducing collection.

### Basic Rules

1. The Deck starts in the command zone
2. Each player begins with 1 Fate Point (maximum 1)
3. Players may spend their Fate Point to draw during their precombat main phase on the  starting player's fifth turn
4. Cards drawn are cast immediately without paying mana costs
5. Full rules can be found in the (https://github.com/SirLoinTheGreat/mtg-domt/blob/main/assets/cards/original/Deck%20of%20Many%20Things%20Rules.png)
